During the PADI Open Water Diver course, youâ€™ll learn what you need to know to explore the underwater world using scuba. The PADI Open Water Diver course includes three parts: Knowledge Development, Confined Water Dives, and Open Water Dives. 

Knowledge Development covers the principles, concepts and terms you need to know for dive safety and enjoyment. 

During the Confined Water Dives, you learn and practice scuba skills in a pool or water with pool-like conditions. 

To complete training you practice, apply and demonstrate what you learn during four Open Water Dives at a local dive site.
