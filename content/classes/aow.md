The PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course improves your underwater knowledge and skills. Any Open Water Diver can enroll regardless of your skill level. The course helps you build confidence in navigation and deep water dives and introduces you to different diving activities such as wreck diving, night diving or underwater photography. After completing your eLearning, youâ€™ll make five Adventure Dives: a deep dive (beyond 60 feet), a navigation dive, and three additional Adventure Dives of your choice to earn your certification.
