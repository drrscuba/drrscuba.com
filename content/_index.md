# SCUBA FOR ALL!

We love SCUBA and we think you will too! We have had some amazing adventures since we discovered scuba diving and want to share it with everyone. Our staff of PADI certified professionals can take you from Open Water Scuba Diver to Master Scuba Diver, and everything in between. If you think helping others learn to dive is as cool as we do we  can even get you started as a PADI Dive Master.

## Our Mission

To bring SCUBA to everyone, whether male, female, young, or old. 

Don't let anyone tell you that you cannot do something because of who you are. We know scuba can be done by almost anyone. All you need is to have someone patient and understanding in the water next to you. Don't believe me? Duane's dad learned to scuba at 77 and loves it. Remember, it's never too late unless you never start.

## Our Slogan is in Our Name

Dive, Rinse, Repeat

It's what we love, it's what we do! Once you the scuba bug bites we think you'll agree!
