Duane is a PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer and when he isnâ€™t teaching can usually be found diving with his camera in hand. After experiencing his own challenges becoming certified, and then falling in love with scuba, he pressed on to become an instructor so he could help others overcome their fears and discover the amazing underwater world. He is a Public Safety Diver with the all volunteer Lee's Summit Underwater Rescue dive team, where he also serves as the current Training Officer.

Outside of SCUBA, Duane is a nerd and runs a small consultancy doing custom software development. He also travels around the United States (and internationally) speaking at technical conferences on the technologies he uses and has been recognized by Microsoft with their MVP (Most Valuable Professional) Award for several years because of his community work.
