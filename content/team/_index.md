# About Our Team

{{< img caption="Duane, Lisa, & Krista" alt="Owners Duane, Lisa, & Krista" src="/img/team/owners01.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" >}}

We are 3 friends that love scuba diving and the aquatic world. We wanted to create a dive shop environment & community that is safe and pleasant for all people that are interested in scuba diving and the aquatic world.

## Where it all started

Krista got certified in 2014 and Duane & Lisa began their SCUBA journey in 2015 and they all immediately fell in love with diving. In 2018 Duane & Krista went through the PADI Instructor Development Course and Instructor Exams together and we discovered we loved diving and teaching together. SCUBA has largely been seen as a male dominated sport and hobby and we saw a need in the diving community to promote and cater SCUBA to women and families and the idea to team up to bring the joy of SCUBA to everyone as born.
