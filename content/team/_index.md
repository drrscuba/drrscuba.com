# About Our Team

{{< img caption="Duane, Lisa, & Krista diving in Maui" alt="Owners Duane & Lisa and instructor Krista" src="/img/team/owners01.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" >}}

We love scuba diving and the aquatic world and wanted to create a dive shop environment & community that is safe and pleasant for all people that are interested in diving into the wonderland of the underwater world.

## Where it all started

Duane & Lisa began their SCUBA journey in 2015 and they all immediately fell in love with diving. They quickly amassed dives and experience and both earned the rating of PADI Master Scuba Divers diving in Bonaire. With Duane's love of teaching he decided to become a PADI professional and became a PADI Divemaster in 2016. During this time we met Krista and quickly became friends. Duane and Krista were both divemasters and decided at the same time to proceeded on to Assistant Instructor and then in 2018 they went through the PADI Instructor Development Course and Instructor Exams together and discovered they loved diving and teaching together. 

Over the next few years we decided it was time to open our own dive shop. We saw that SCUBA has largely been seen as a male dominated sport and we wanted to change that perception. Our goal was to open a shop that would promote and cater SCUBA to women and families and we knew that with Duane & Krista as instructors we could achieve that goal. So that was exactly what we did in March of 2020, when we created Dive Rinse Repeat Scuba, LLC. Little did we know that 5 days later the whole world would shut down. But we didn't let a little world-wide pandemic stop us from sharing our love of scuba, we just scaled back and made some adjustments. We took our time, safely working with private classes until things settled down. Now we are ready to bring SCUBA to you and give you the opportunity to discover the amazing aquatic world!
