Krista became Open Water Certified in 2014 and was instantly hooked on Scuba! She is a PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer and has been an instructor since 2018. As a Disabled Divers International Assistant Diver (she is working her way towards instructor) she is able to teach divers at any physical level. When she isn’t teaching you can find her underwater, spinning around, playing with nearby aquatic life. Krista enjoys all types of diving, but especially loves shark, wreck, and macro dives. She gives back to the community as a volunteer Public Safety Diver with the Lee's Summit Underwater Rescue, a community funded non-profit. One of her biggest accomplishments in Scuba, besides earning her MSDT, is obtaining a Tech 50 Certification.

Out of the water, Krista works full time as a cash receipts manager and business analyst, freelance harpist, and Co-Chief of Lee’s Summit Underwater Rescue and Recovery.
