<!-- !["nudibranch"](/img/locations/volivoli/Volivoli-Fiji-Bligh-Water-small.jpg#floatright)  -->

> Arriving at the resort mid-day, you can go shore diving as soon as you are settled in, if you are up to it!

We will be staying right off the Bligh Waters, also known as The Vatu-I-Ra Passage, a marine protected area famous for its abundance and diversity of marine lif and the best soft coral diving in Fiji. These sites are a mixture of walls, bommies and drift dives, all of which are teaming with life and colour. Sites like Black magic mountain, Mellow yellow and Instant replay will soon be etched in your memory forever! You’re going to see the healthiest soft coral in the world, more colours than you can imagine, and some extremely rare macro creatures—like the ornate ghost pipefish, orangutan crabs, frogfish, nudibranch, seahorses, schools of barracuda, trevally, giant groupers, and in all likelihood, turtles, moray eels, grey, blacak and white tip reef sharks, and the occasional tiger shark. 

When you're done diving for the day there is plenty to do, including snorkeling, kayaking, beach volleyball, and many more activities for hire. 

Enjoy Fiji’s best snorkeling directly off the beach! Boasting some of the best snorkeling in Fiji, the waters around Volivoli Beach are full of colorful soft coral and marine life. What’s more, you can snorkel at any time of day, as the deep water bay means low tide isn’t a problem.

Or you could head out on one the included sea kayaks. The water here is so clear you’ll be able to watch brightly colored tropical fish and bright blue starfish as you paddle around. It’s up to you how much you want to do in your kayak. You could pack a picnic and spend the whole day afloat. Or you might prefer a more adventurous kayak around the bay to explore the hidden coves and mangrove forests. Or you can simply float around listening to the gentle splash of your paddles.
