### Buddy Dive

Buddy Dive is one of the largest Bonaire dive resorts. Their apartments all have ocean or garden views, and are comfortably furnished, to accommodate you, your family or friends. Each apartment has a fully equipped kitchen, spacious living area with cable TV, patio or balcony, air-conditioned bedrooms each with its own bathroom with shower. All apartments have a room safe, with no extra charge, to store valuables.

Built with active people in mind, Buddy Dive knows exactly what is needed to make guests comfortable both during their busy day of diving and exploring, and after.

For sunbathing in a location with the ultimate view, there’s no place better than on our raised sand beach areas overlooking the clear, turquoise waters of the Caribbean. A short stairway provides easy access to the tranquil ocean below – excellent for snorkelling and swimming.
