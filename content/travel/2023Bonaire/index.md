# A Divers Paradise 

<!-- !["bonaire boat sunset"](/img/locations/bonaire/boatsunset.jpg#floatright)  -->

Bonaire is truly a diver's paradise! It has been consistently rated as a top dive destination around the world and is just a 4 hour flight from Atlanta and 5 hour flight from Houston. Once there, take your rental truck (included with each apartment) and your dive buddy along the coastal road to choose which of the about 60 official dive sites you want to explore. With so many dive sites easily accessible from shore it has become the shore diving capital of the world. Tired of driving and wading out into the deep blue? No problem, catch one of the 6 dive boats regularly departing for dive sites along the coast or around Klein Bonaire (a small island preserved as a nature reserve).

> Get ready for lots of bottom time with unlimited shore diving and free nitrox!

Bonaire’s sea abounds with beautiful marine life and a fascinating variety of multi-colored tropical fish, there is lots to see while diving on Bonaire. The sea is remarkably calm, and conditions are superb for both scuba diving and snorkeling. On average, while diving on Bonaire, the visibility exceeds 100 feet and the average water temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Bonaire’s waters offer something special for every diver. Novice divers will appreciate the calm waters while diving in Bonaire, reefs that run parallel to shore, and minimal currents. These conditions make it an ideal location to really work on improving those buoyancy skills! The shallow drop-off area of the reef slope with an abundance of marine life allows for a maximum bottom time while giving new divers an opportunity to develop a level of comfort and confidence in their newly learned skills.

When you need a break from diving take a drive through the local donkey sanctuary, watch the flamingos by the salt flats, visit Washington Slagbaai National Park, and more.
